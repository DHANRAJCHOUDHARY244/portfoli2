                    Since
                    beginning my
                    journey as a freelance designer nearly 2 years ago,
                    I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for
                    startups, and collaborated with talented people to
                    create digital products for both business and consumer
                    use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and
                    perpetually working on improving my chopsone design
                    problem at a time.
